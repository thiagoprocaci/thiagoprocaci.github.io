      <description>Overview This is a step-by-step of how to classify thumbnail images with deep learning models using PyTorch library. All references to Python code (classes, method) can be found at this GitHub repository.
Problem  Given two youtube channels, what thumbnail corresponds to each channel? It is a problem of image classification. We choose two YouTube channels to perform this classification: Nerdologia and Peixe Babel.  Downloading Thumbnails We are going to use CNN (convolutional neural network) to solve the problem.</description>

      <title>Polonius&#39; advice to Laertes and the contemporary world</title>

      <description>Polonius and Laertes are characters in Shakespeare&amp;rsquo;s Hamlet. I encourage the study of classics such as Hamlet since we have a lot to learn from them. The play is a tragedy, set in Denmark, where Prince Hamlet seeks to avenge the death of his father who was murdered by his brother Claudius. Afterward, Claudius became the king. The plot is about this regicide.
Polonius was the silly man of the kingdom (tedious old fool as described by Prince Hamlet) and the chief counselor of Claudius.</description>

      <title>Data Science: trend, applicability and new data</title>

      <description>Recently, I have been involved in data science projects as never before. Data science is a trend. Saying that someone is data scientist is nice but few know what (s)he actually does. My experience tells that applying techniques quite easy, even in the data science field. The challenge is to find a problem that a technique solves.
Back to the beginning, why am I asked to solve issues through data science?</description>

      <description>Many of us describe ourselves applying labels that shape our identity. Someone says, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m a musician&amp;rdquo;, and this behavior gives him a sense of belonging, feeling connected to a group. Others prefer to describe themselves by their characteristics, hobbies or lifestyle such as vegetarians, extroverts, gamer, easygoing. Each label indicates a set of habits.
Zygmunt Bauman, a sociologist who described the world from a fascinating perspective, says that we live in the liquid modernity in which everything changes quickly and nothing is done to last.</description>

      <title>Innovation and Invention</title>

      <description>I have been working as a software developer for a long time and I usually listen to my coworkers’ opinions using arguments like “our company needs to innovate”. However, when you talk about innovation in a company, you will see people coming up with ideas such as technology adoption or the usage of a new cool methodology to create or improve something. Everybody agrees that it is good to create new things and some people feel proud of their creation.</description>
