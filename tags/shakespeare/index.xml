      <description>&lt;p&gt;Polonius and Laertes are characters in Shakespeare&amp;rsquo;s Hamlet. I encourage the study of classics such as Hamlet since we have a lot to learn from them. The play is a tragedy, set in Denmark, where Prince Hamlet seeks to avenge the death of his father who was murdered by his brother Claudius. Afterward, Claudius became the king. The plot is about this regicide.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Polonius was the silly man of the kingdom (tedious old fool as described by Prince Hamlet)  and the chief counselor of Claudius. Laertes is the son of Polonius and Laertes is leaving for France. In this scene, Shakespeare&amp;rsquo;s ability appears in Polonius&amp;rsquo;s advice to Laertes before his departure for France. In other words, Shakespeare surprises us when he makes wise words come from the silliest person in the kingdom, Polonius. The advice can be divided into 8 recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
