      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been working as a software developer for a long time and I usually listen to my coworkers’ opinions using arguments like “our company needs to innovate”. However, when you talk about innovation in a company, you will see people coming up with ideas such as technology adoption or the usage of a new cool methodology to create or improve something.&#xA;Everybody agrees that it is good to create new things and some people feel proud of their creation. However, innovation is not just a creation or a simple improvement. It is a more complex process.&#xA;In this text, I would like to discuss innovation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
